## Profile
Data scientist with hands-on experience in machine learning, statistical analysis, data visualization and big data. On one hand, I am capable of delivering results relevant to current business needs. And on the other hand, interested in a research for new data- and ML-driven products. My favorite tool for day-to-day work is Python, but I am also familiar with R. Favorite library for deep learning is pytorch.
