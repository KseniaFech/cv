## Profile
Data scientist with hands-on experience in machine learning, statistical analysis, data visualization and big data. On one hand, I am capable of delivering results relevant to current business needs. And on the other hand, interested in a research for new data- and ML-driven products. My favorite tool for day-to-day work is Python, but I am also familiar with R.

## Work experience
#### Senior data scientist at [DCA](http://dca.ru): October 2017 - Present
DCA is a programmatic advertising platform and is one of the largest DMPs in Russia, seeing data from millions of sites every day. Here I build end-to-end systems that help to make sense of the data in unsupervised way: **1.** Automatic audience segments creation based on target keywords; **2.** Web pages categorization based on word2vec vecorization; **3.** Audience look-alike segmentation; **4.** Highload banner CTR prediction with Tensorflow and Tensorflow Serving.

#### Data analyst at R&D at [Flocktory](https://www.flocktory.com): November 2014 - September 2017
Designed and built data tools and products using Flocktory's data on activity of visitors of the majority of Russia's largest e-commerce sites. Flocktory sees tens of GBs of data per day. This causes major challenges in extracting value and insights from it, thus a large variety of tools is used in the process.
Tools and products include (but not limited to): **1.** Matching product catalogs (taxonomies) of different shops onto a universal taxonomy; **2.** Identifying patterns in goods for promotions, e.g. the products that are purchased repeatedly; **3.** Building and maintaining dashboards and the data for the dashboards both for internal and external use.

#### Pricing analyst at [Mamsy](https://mamsy.ru): March 2013 - November 2014  
Mamsy is a e-commerce retail based on flash-sales model. In there Iâ€™ve decided on buying and selling prices based on expected costs, monitored and analyzed competitors' pricing.
